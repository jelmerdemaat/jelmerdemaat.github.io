One of the volunteer projects I continuously contribute to is the athletics club SPRINT in Breda. For them I maintain the website technically, amongst other things. The website is a WordPress based custom theme built with a build system of *Grunt* and *SASS*. It uses plugins for things such as calendar functionality with custom themes attached to it.

My history with this club goes back many years, which is why I will continue to work voluntarily for this project with enthusiasm and passion.
