Since 2011 I have been a founding member of De Jongens van de TU, a web design, development and branding bureau consisting of Eindhoven’s brightest students.

Executing our combined powers in both technical and design fields, we develop websites, applications and branding material for technical companies in and around Eindhoven.

The area of Eindhoven houses a lot of technical companies that know a lot about science, but little about design, marketing and websites. This is where De Jongens van de TU comes in. We can give shape to the thoughts and intentions of these technical companies and express these in their website and marketing material. We translate science to make it understandable for the anybody visiting the website, and thus build up important online audience for these clients.

My work in De Jongens involves heaps of front-end programming, WordPress theme buillding, website management and client communication on a daily basis.
Since January 2013 I have been Chief Development at De Jongens van de TU.
