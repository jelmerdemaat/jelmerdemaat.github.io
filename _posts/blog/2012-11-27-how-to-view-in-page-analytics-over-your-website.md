title: How to view the In-Page Analytics overlay on your website
categories: [blog]

<p>If you have a website, <a href="http://w3techs.com/technologies/details/ta-googleanalytics/all/all" title="Percentages of Google Analytics users on the web" target="_blank">chances are</a> you're using Google Analytics to analyze your site's traffic. One of the more interesting and fun features is the In-Page Analytics view, where you can track exactly on which elements users click the most, and what your users' most used browser sizes are. You can even use a slider to scroll through the different browser sizes and see the percentage of users browsing your site or even any specific page with that resolution.</p>
<p>What's a bummer is that the interface of Google Analytics is not always as nice and usable as you would want. The following is a smart trick to see more of your website and less of Analytics.</p>
<p>Log in to your <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/" target="_blank">Google Analytics panel</a>, choose your website, and go to <em>Content > In-Page Analytics</em>. Then, open a new tab and just go to the url of your current website. You should see an overlay of In-Page Analytics at the top of your site. Yay! More website space, less Google Analytics panels. In my experience you can even close the previous Google Analytics tab.<br />Â </p>

<p>Note: to close the panel, you have to close the Google Analytics tab as well as the site overlay, using the "Exit" button.</p>
