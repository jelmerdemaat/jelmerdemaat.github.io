Hi there!

This is the first of (hopefully) many posts that are going to be published on this piece of internet. I have finally taken some time to create a blog-thing of my own, and even though it is small, it will serve its purpose for the coming months or so.

What you can expect here is mostly my experiments with and general thoughts on front-end development, meaning, CSS, HTML and JavaScript. The posts will be about techniques, browsers, developments of web technologies and other nerd stuff. I hope I can contribute to the discussions out there.

I have gathered some fun ideas for posts and experiments in the past months, so expect to have some good reading time here!

See you here in the near future!
