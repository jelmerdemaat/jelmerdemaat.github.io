## About me

The thing I am most passionate about is development for the web. Creating for the internet is
creating for everybody: open technology in its most accessible form.

But at least as exciting are the tools we use to shape the build process, the complete meta side of
web development. I believe that in its core, this meta side is a philosophy of efficiency that can
be applied to many industries.

The web is so young, it is continuously evolving. That is why it is so exciting to be a part of it:
stand up now with a great idea, and it could change how people make websites all over the world. Big
websites might be using your code, your ideas.

And itâ€™s relatively simple! Start coding and find out what lies in the undiscovered areas of web
development. Write, share and contribute and maybe you discover something completely new!
